ISENTINEL DEMO SCRIPT - 0G BOUNTY PROJECT
==========================================

üé¨ INTRODUCTION (30 seconds)
----------------------------
"Welcome to iSentinel - a revolutionary AI incident reporting system built on 0G's decentralized infrastructure. 

Today I'll show you how iSentinel transforms AI failures into verifiable, immutable NFTs, creating accountability and transparency in AI systems.

Let's dive into a live demonstration."

üîó WALLET CONNECTION (15 seconds)
--------------------------------
[Open the frontend application]

"First, let's connect our wallet to the 0G Galileo testnet."

[Click "Connect Wallet" button]
[Show wallet connection success with address displayed]

"Perfect! We're now connected to the 0G blockchain."

üìä DASHBOARD OVERVIEW (30 seconds)
----------------------------------
"Here's our real-time incident dashboard. You can see:
- Total incidents reported across the network
- Critical incidents requiring immediate attention  
- Recent activity in the last 24 hours

Each incident card shows the severity level, timestamp, and NFT token ID. The data comes directly from the 0G blockchain, ensuring complete transparency."

üö® REPORTING AN INCIDENT (60 seconds)
------------------------------------
[Click "Report Incident" button]

"Now let's report a real AI incident. I'll click 'Report Incident'."

[Fill out the form with realistic data:]

**Title:** "GPT Model Hallucination - Financial Data"

**Severity:** Critical

**Description:** "AI model generated false financial information during customer query, potentially affecting trading decisions. Model confidence was below threshold but still provided incorrect data."

**Logs:** "ERROR: Model confidence: 0.23, Source: financial_db_query, Validation: FAILED
Timestamp: 2025-10-05T10:30:00Z
Input: 'What is the current price of AAPL?'
Output: '$245.67' (Actual: $178.23)
Error: Hallucinated price data detected
Stack trace: financial_model.py:line 142"

**AI Model:** "GPT-4"

**Version:** "v2.1.0"

[Click "Report Incident"]

"As I submit this, several things happen simultaneously:
1. The incident metadata is being uploaded to 0G Storage for permanent preservation
2. The logs are stored immutably on 0G's decentralized storage network  
3. An NFT is being minted on the 0G blockchain as proof of this incident"

üéâ SUCCESS & VERIFICATION (45 seconds)
--------------------------------------
[Wait for success modal]

"Excellent! The incident has been successfully reported and minted as an NFT.

You can see:
- Our unique NFT Token ID
- The transaction hash on 0G blockchain
- A direct link to view this on the 0G Explorer

This NFT now represents immutable proof that this AI incident occurred. It can be transferred, sold, or used for compliance reporting."

[Click "View on 0G Explorer" if available]

"The 0G Explorer shows the actual blockchain transaction, proving this incident was recorded immutably and can be verified by anyone."

üîÑ DASHBOARD UPDATE (30 seconds)
-------------------------------
[Close modal, return to dashboard]

"Back on our dashboard, you can see the stats have updated in real-time. Our new incident appears at the top of the list.

Notice how the data flows seamlessly between:
- 0G Storage for log preservation
- 0G Blockchain for immutable proof
- Our frontend for user interaction"

üë§ MY INCIDENTS (30 seconds)
----------------------------
[Scroll to "Your Incident NFTs" section]

"In the 'Your Incident NFTs' section, you can see all incidents you own. Each NFT contains the full original report data - title, description, and logs."

[Click on an incident NFT]

"When I click on any incident, the detail modal shows the complete original report data, fetched directly from 0G Storage. This includes:
- The exact title I entered
- Full description with context
- Complete error logs and technical details
- AI model information"

üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS (45 seconds)
------------------------------------
[Show backend terminal briefly if running]

"Behind the scenes, our backend integrates with:

**0G Storage:** Provides decentralized, permanent storage for logs and metadata. Unlike traditional cloud storage, this data cannot be deleted or modified.

**0G Blockchain:** High-performance, low-cost transactions for NFT minting. Each incident becomes a tradeable, verifiable asset.

**Future 0G Compute:** We're planning integration with 0G's compute layer for automated incident analysis and pattern detection."

üéØ IMPACT & CONCLUSION (30 seconds)
----------------------------------
"iSentinel solves critical problems in AI governance:

‚úÖ **Accountability:** Every AI failure becomes permanent, traceable evidence
‚úÖ **Transparency:** Incidents can't be hidden or deleted
‚úÖ **Compliance:** Auditable trail for regulatory requirements  
‚úÖ **Transferability:** Incidents can be traded as valuable data assets
‚úÖ **Decentralization:** No single point of failure or control

This is the future of AI incident management - built on 0G's complete decentralized infrastructure."

‚è∞ TOTAL DURATION: ~5 minutes

üìù DEMO NOTES:
- Have backend running: `node backend/serverOG.js`
- Ensure wallet has test tokens for gas
- Practice the form filling for smooth demo
- Have 0G Explorer link ready if needed
- Emphasize the decentralized aspect throughout
- Highlight how this creates a new data economy around AI incidents
