### **Tweet 1/10 - Hook**
```
🚀 We just deployed the FIRST AI accountability platform using 100% of the @0G_Builders stack on MAINNET!

iSentinel turns every AI failure into a verifiable iNFT with oracle-backed proof and real decentralized AI analytics.

Here's our complete #WaveHack journey 🧵👇

### **Tweet 2/10 - The Problem**
```
2/ 💡 THE PROBLEM:

AI systems fail every day:
• Medical AI gives wrong dosages
• Hiring AI shows gender bias
• Chatbots leak personal data

But there's NO transparent, immutable record of these failures.

No accountability = No trust = No adoption.
```

### **Tweet 3/10 - Our Solution**
```
3/ ✅ THE SOLUTION: iSentinel

Every AI incident becomes:
🎨 Oracle-verified iNFT (not basic ERC721)
📦 Immutable logs on @0G_Builders Storage
🧠 AI-analyzed via @0G_Builders Compute
🔐 Encrypted metadata with access control

Complete transparency, complete decentralization.
```
